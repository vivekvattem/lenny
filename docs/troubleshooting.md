# Operational troubleshooting

Use the visible request reference and saved session/run ID to correlate safe JSON events. Do not paste keys, full prompts, transcripts or raw RPC traces into reports. Refresh readiness and saved state before retrying; never switch provider automatically.

| Symptom | Diagnosis / recovery | This phase's evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Selected cloud unavailable | `cloud_key_missing`: configure the key server-side or explicitly return to Ollama, then bootstrap/refresh. No writes/process start on key absence. | Actual isolated API503, UI fixture and recovery; cloud inference blocked |
| Ollama unavailable | Start the existing host daemon; verify container-to-host connectivity and readiness. On Linux check bridge bind/host-gateway. | Actual unreachable loopback target then recovery; normal daemon not stopped |
| Local model missing | Check `ollama list` against configured names; assess memory/disk before an authorized pull. No substitution/fallback. | Real tag check with deliberately absent configured name gives readiness503; restore config200 |
| Model timeout | Saved run `answer_timeout`/essay timeout; refresh, then bounded retry using the same saved question. Reduce scope/context or reassess hardware after measured failures. | Real mock subprocess timeout/reaping, bridge closure and same-ID retry; live local smoke separate |
| Empty corpus/evidence | Counts/status are empty; ingest/refresh the correct pinned corpus, or narrow to a supported question. Do not treat nearby matches as proof. | Actual isolated corpus state and recovery; existing empty-answer contracts |
| PostgreSQL unavailable | Liveness remains200, readiness/API503 `database_unavailable`; restore the configured DB connection, preserve volumes, refresh/retry. | Real refused test endpoint and recovered SQL request; normal DB never stopped |
| Embedding/index mismatch | Configured model/digest/dimensions must match stored identity. Restore correct config or plan an explicit re-index. Never rename vectors to suppress mismatch. | Actual model dimension check, retrieval identity tests and recovery |
| Interrupted stream/cancel | Refresh the saved run before retrying. Same request identity prevents duplicate messages. | Actual stream-generator disconnect and cancel with real mock process/bridge cleanup; UI fixture states separate |
| Malformed/oversized artifact | Safe422 `artifact_too_large`, correlated rendering code. Restore/recreate from the owned accepted reply; arbitrary new HTML remains sanitized/isolated. | Actual isolated stored-artifact mutation/recovery and existing hostile renderer/browser tests |
| Bootstrap fails | Check Docker/Compose and port ownership, safe `.env` validation and available disk. Do not print resolved secret configuration. | Warm existing-stack rehearsal6.60s, `.env`/corpus preserved; cold clone/other OS unverified |

Nonfatal psycopg ResourceWarnings occurred at contract-process shutdown; passing assertions do not prove all teardown warnings resolved. Production engine disposal is in app lifespan, and model-process/bridge cleanup has explicit tests. Report repeatable leaks instead of suppressing warnings.

Use the published README for the current source snapshot. Cloud checks are historical and do not establish present credentials or credits. See the [verification summary](verification.md). Keep keys configured server-side; never send them through chat.
